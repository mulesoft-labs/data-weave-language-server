## Project initialization

In order for this plugin to be able to provide information, all dependencies need to be loaded and indexed. 
For this there is a notification when the dependencies are being loaded and indexing is finished.

## Sample Data

Sample Data is a key part of a DW project development. It is going to be used to run your scripts and also for suggestions.

To Specify Sample Data, just click on the Code Lense _Specify Sample Data_

## Create New Mapping

This plugin supports different kind of projects. And each project has different project layouts.

The action of Create New Mapping will create the file in the correct folder.

## Preview/ Live Preview

Once sample data is set a user can have live feedback on how the script is working. There are two ways. 
One is to trigger it by hand when the user wants to execute it, or can enable AutoPreview by right clicking
on the editor.

## Running/Debugging a Mapping

In order to run a Mapping the fastest way is to use the Code Lense _Run Mapping_ that should appear in the top of your DW script.

This is going to guide through all the things that are needed. The user can set breakpoints to stop evaluate expressions 
and all the debugging capabilities that VSCode provides.
